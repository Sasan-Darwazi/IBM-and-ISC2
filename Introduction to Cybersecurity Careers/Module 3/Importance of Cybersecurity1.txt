Importance of Cybersecurity: 

You'll learn about the different types of technical skills pertaining to cybersecurity and their importance in protecting the organization's digital information. After watching this video, you'll be able to, identify cybersecurity technical skills, describe the importance of each skill. Let's look at several essential cybersecurity skills for cybersecurity professionals. These include information security and assurance, security operations, cryptography, risk management, threat analysis, authentication, and network security. Information security and assurance is the cornerstone of cybersecurity. Information security and assurance refers to the practices and measures to protect digital and nondigital information from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction. As the volume and value of digital data increases exponentially, the need for trained professionals who can ensure its integrity, confidentiality, and accessibility becomes equally critical. 

They are responsible for implementing security policies, managing user access controls, and conducting regular audits to ensure compliance. Security operations refers to the actions and activities dedicated to identifying, investigating, and resolving security incidents within an organization's information system. Cybersecurity professionals maintain and monitor security infrastructure, conduct incident response activities, and collaborate with other teams to manage security incidents effectively. Cryptography is the science of protecting information by transforming it into a secure format. It provides data confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity in an insecure environment. Cryptographers create algorithms and ciphers to encrypt data making it unreadable to anyone without the decryption key. Cybersecurity professionals need to understand the fundamental principles of cryptography, including symmetric and asymmetric encryption, hashing and digital signatures. 


They must be familiar with implementing encryption protocols to secure data in transit and at rest. They should be aware of the potential vulnerabilities that can arise if they do not use protocols correctly. They should also understand how to manage encryption keys, including the processes of essential generation, distribution, storage, and exploration. Risk in cybersecurity is the result of uncertainty in information and technology. Risk management is identifying, assessing, and prioritizing these risks, followed by implementing processes and resources to minimize the impact of these risks. In cybersecurity, this means understanding the potential threats facing an organization's information systems and making informed decisions to mitigate those risks. It involves conducting risk assessments, creating risk mitigation strategies, and monitoring the effectiveness of these strategies.

 
Cybersecurity professionals use threat management to prevent cyber attacks, detect threats, and respond to security incidents. Threat hunting involves proactively identifying and isolating threats that automated security solutions may not notice. It requires a deep understanding of the organization's network including normal and abnormal system behaviors, thus uncovering malicious activities. Cyber professionals use threat intelligence analytics and up-to-date threat data to actively search, analyze, and remediate potential threats that evade existing security solutions. Vulnerability management is continuously discovering, prioritizing, and resolving security vulnerabilities in an organization's IT infrastructure and hardware. Analysts identify and secure potential vulnerabilities, helping organizations stay ahead of potential attackers. This process includes vulnerability scanning, which uses tools to detect potential system network or application vulnerabilities. 


Penetration testing is another essential part of vulnerability assessment. It involves simulating hacker activities to verify the existence of vulnerabilities and understand their potential impact on the system if exploited. Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user, device, or system. It's a fundamental aspect of access control, ensuring that only authorized individuals or systems can access specific resources. Skills in designing and implementing robust authentication methods like multi-factor authentication, biometrics, and digital certificates are essential in preventing unauthorized access and subsequent data breaches. In this video, you learned that as cyber threats continue to grow and evolve, the need for professionals with cybersecurity technical skills will increase. With these skills, cybersecurity professionals can protect organization's information assets, and maintain their data's integrity, confidentiality, and availability.
