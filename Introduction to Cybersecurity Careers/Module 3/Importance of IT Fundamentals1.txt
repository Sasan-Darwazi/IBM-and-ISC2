Importance of IT Fundamentals: 
Welcome to Importance of IT Fundamentals and Technical Skills. After watching this video, you'll be able to: identify the basic IT skills required by a cybersecurity professional, describe the need for understanding basic hardware operating systems, networking, programming, databases, and cloud to identify potential threats or vulnerabilities. The Foundation for Cybersecurity Excellence is built upon robust information technology IT fundamental skills. These skills include hardware, operating systems, networking, programming, databases, and cloud. Hardware knowledge is the first step toward understanding the physical elements that make up a computer system. These components include the monitor, keyboard, mouse, processor, hard drive, and RAM. Each piece of hardware plays a crucial role in processing, storing and inputting information necessary for the system to function. 

Monitoring hardware components and ensuring their security is integral to prevent unauthorized access and protecting sensitive data. Knowledge of the fundamentals of computer hardware can also aid in identifying potential threats or vulnerabilities, such as malware embedded in hardware components. Operating systems, OS, serve as the bridge between the hardware and the software applications running on a computer. An OS is a software that manages computer hardware and software resources, providing a range of services for different software applications to run on a computer. It is responsible for managing and coordinating the use of hardware among various application programs. Its vital role includes controlling and allocating memory, prioritizing system requests, controlling input and output devices, and managing file systems. Understanding operating systems mechanics helps cybersecurity professionals detect abnormalities, handle vulnerabilities, and improve system defenses. 

This includes knowledge of managing user privileges, system updates and patches, which can help prevent access by malicious software or hackers. Networking knowledge is critical to the cybersecurity field. Networking refers to linking two or more computing devices together to share data. It involves a network's design, construction and use, encompassing various technologies, devices and protocols. This forms the basis of data exchange and communication in the digital world, making it a crucial area of understanding for cybersecurity professionals. Cyber threats often target network vulnerabilities. For securing the systems, it is important to understand how data transfers from one computer to another and how different network components interact. 


You should be able to recognize suspicious network behavior and identify potential attacks, taking appropriate preventive measures. A rudimentary grasp of programming is another essential skill. Programming creates instructions that computers can interpret and execute to perform a specific task or solve a problem. It involves writing, testing, debugging and maintaining the source code of computer programs. This source code is written in a programming language which acts as the interface between human logic and machine operations. While cybersecurity professionals don't necessarily need to be developers, understanding the basics of coding helps automate tasks, identify software vulnerabilities, and understand attack vectors. Familiarity with scripts and code can enable the development of tools for penetration testing and aid in discovering and rectifying security vulnerabilities. 


Database knowledge is also critical due to the sensitive information stored within these systems. A database is a structured set of data organized to facilitate efficient retrieval, addition, modification and deletion of data. It is the backbone of many applications storing information such as user data, transaction details or product records. You should understand how to store, retrieve and protect data to help prevent unauthorized access and breaches. Knowledge of SQL and NoSQL databases, encryption and access control mechanisms is particularly valuable for cybersecurity practitioners. Lastly, cloud basics form an essential part of the IT foundation for cybersecurity. Cloud computing is a technology model that enables on demand access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources such as networks, servers, storage, applications and services
